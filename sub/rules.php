    <li><p>Monday is <strong>not</strong> counted in AP, this is a day off where houses can post [NEWS] for the week relating to their holding. 
    [EVENTS] cannot be created, nor [CONFLICTS]. Basically, no action other than [NEWS], [CLAIM] or [META] can take place on Monday.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Claims</h2>
<p>First thing is first, you need some land and a nice holdfast to rule over. Keep in mind every holdfast has a set amount of men they can rally from their lands and a set yearly income. More that those later, but the links are in sidebar for a quick glimpse. </p>
<p>Before claiming double check to make sure it is open. Check the 'Claimable Holdfasts' on the sidebar and/or message the mods for we can make sure for you, then make a [Claim] post with the holdfast in the title, and your information in the body. Feel free to write up a interesting post about taking control of the hold but at the very least include the hold name and what you want your flair to be. </p>
<p>After you make your claim and you still don't have your flair and wiki access, make a comment in the Wiki and Flair Requests to alert the mods. </p>
<p>A lord may have multiple claims, so if a lord has a hold you want, send them a nice PM asking if they will let you take control of it. They may require a oath of fealty or may not want to give it up, if they have a claim on it it is up to them whether they want to give it to you. </p>
<p>There is also an option to claim as a person in a holdfast, if you do not want to deal with the complexities of the game and just enjoy exploring the realm. </p>
<h2>Expansions</h2>
<h3>Conquest</h3>
<p>While we would like to see people using wit and cunning to gain power, combat is also a vital part of the game and at time you may need to conquer another hold. When you take a Hold from someone the loser has two options, Give up their claim to you or swear fealty to you. If they give up their claim, you gain control of the hold and its man power. If they swear fealty you are now their liege lord and may call upon them in war. (Vassals are still allowed to plot against you). If you have any doubts feel free to send us a Message.</p>
<h3>Inactivity</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>To make sure houses don't become dormant, we will be enforcing active participation.</p></li>
<li><p>TO BE CONSIDERED ACTIVE YOU MUST MAKE AT LEAST ONE [EVENT] PER WEEK</p></li>
<li><p>THE ABOVE INCLUDES THE WEEKLY RANDOM EVENT</p></li>
<li><p>You must also participate in News Days and post your [News] on Mondays</p></li>
<li><p>If you fail to do so and it comes to our attention, then you will be given 1 day's notice before we default your house.</p></li>

<h3 id="wiki_.5Bconflict-rally.5D">[Conflict-Rally]</h3>
<p>All combat must have a [Combat-Rally] post (except surprise but more on that later). A combat rally post must include who and where you are attacking, how many men you are attacking with. Your allies can use the comment to assist you in combat. Only troop numbers from the rally will be counted.   </p>
<p>If someone makes a Rally post against you, you can make your own Rally post which you can call your allies to your defense, This works the same as the Attacker Rally, only troop counts posted in the rally will be counted. </p>
<p>Once 24hrs have passed You may move on to a conflict commit, or if both sides agree to cut the long wait short, or if the city does not have any defenders.(this last one need mod permission)</p>
<h3 id="wiki_.5Bconflict-commit.5D">[Conflict-Commit]</h3>
<p>When you have all of your allies assembled and it has been 24hrs since your rally post you may post a [Conflict-Commit] after a commit from either side has been made neither side may add any troops to a rally. This means your troops have engaged in combat. A mod will then run your battle and post the results. </p>
<p><strong>Make the mod's life easy and post both sides rallies in your commit so he don't have to go digging for it</strong></p>
<h3 id="wiki_.5Bconflict-surprise.5D">[Conflict-Surprise]</h3>
<p>Sometimes it makes tactical sense to do a sneak attack on a enemy. If you wish to do a [Conflict-Surprise] You must do several things</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You must make a vague [Event post about your troop movement to justify your men didn't come from thin air, Or you can make a [Conflict-Rally] to a place close by but then switch to the new location.</p></li>
<li><p>You must send a mod message with details outlining exactly what you want to do, include your plan, troop numbers, and anything else relevant. If a the majority of mods think it is reasonable it will be approved and you will be given the go ahead. </p></li>
<li><p>Once you get the Mod Ok, you may make a [Conflict-Surprise] Post which works like a [Conflict-Commit].</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wiki_.5Bconflict-score.5D">[Conflict-Score]</h3>

<p><strong>Thanks <a href="/u/BisonST" rel="nofollow">/u/BisonST</a> for typing most of this out<br>
This system is in effect as of right now.</strong></p>
<p>The mods have been working on a better battle system(2.0). We were hoping to work on this more, but recent events have thrown the game into conflict. Expect changes to this system later down the road.</p>
<p><strong>Starting a Conflict</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Normally all conflicts must begin with a <strong>[CONFLICT - RALLY]</strong> post. This post represents a host bringing their forces together for a fight. Normally at least 24 IRL hours must pass before a commit post is made. </p></li>
<li><p>If the two sides agree, or if a mod makes a ruling, you may skip straight to the commit phase. </p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>[CONFLICT - COMMIT]</strong> post indicates that the attack has been launched by the poster. </p></li>
<li><p>The mods will then make a <strong>[CONFLICT-SCORE]</strong> post ASAP. This conflict score post will use the below rules to declare a victor.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Fighting the Conflict</strong></p>
<p>We will be using simple 6 sided dies (d6), 3 sided dies (d3), and 5 sided dies (d5) to represent combat. For now we will manually use online generators but in the future we hope to have a bot perform these rolls. The number of which will be decided like this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In our example battle we have the following two sides: Side 1 consists of 1,000 men. Side 2 consists of 500 men. </p></li>
<li><p>Add both sides together to get the full number of troops in the battle, then divide each side's forces by that number to see the percentages. For example, a battle of 1,000 vs. 500 would be 66% and 33% respectively. </p></li>
<li><p>Each side's percentages will be rounded to the nearest 5%, so in this example it would be 65% and 35%. Each side will receive 1d6 for every 10%, any remaining 5% will give a 1d3. In the above example,the Side 1 (65%) force will receive 6d6 + 1d3. Side 2 (35%) will receive 3d6 + 1d3.</p></li>
<li><p>The results of the rolls will be added to create the initial score. The defender during a siege will receive a bonus to the their initial score equal to the defense value of the battle site. In this example, Side 2 will have a defense value of 4. The final result of all modifiers is the Battle Score.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Defense bonus is based on the location of the defender and added to the end of the final total </p>
<p><strong>Final = Total of Dice + Bonus</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Half the Defense value is added to the total dice sides. So a defense rating of 6 would add 3 making a D6 a D9.   </p>
<p>In this example let's assume the following rolls: </p>
<ul>
<li>Side 1 (1,000 men, 65%): 1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 6, +2 (from the 1d3)</li>
<li><p>Side 2 (500 men, 35%): 3, 6, 6, +1 (from the 1d3), +4 (from defense)</p></li>
<li><p>Side 1 Battle Score: 25</p></li>
<li><p>Side 2 Battle Score: 20</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Side 1 wins by 5!</p>
<p>During a battle in the open field this usually means the losing side is routed or retreats. During a siege the battle will continue until either side gives in or runs out of troops.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Tie Goes To the Defender</strong></p>
<p><strong>Determining Casualties</strong></p>
<p>Causalities will be determined as follows:</p>
<p>For the smaller army the average of all d6 rolls will be averaged together (round normally). In the above example that would result in an average of 5 ((6 + 6 + 3) / 3) kill dice for side 2. This determines how many kill dice (d5s) will be rolled for enemy causalities.</p>
<p>For the larger army, the highest d6 rolls equal to the amount of the smaller armies rolls will be averaged. In the above example that would mean the 3 highest (6,6,5) rolls would be averaged together for a result of 5.67, rounded to 6. The larger army (side 1) will roll 6d5 kill dice.</p>
<p>These d5 represent the percentage of causalities the opposing side will suffer. The winner will receive a bonus to their kill results equal to the amount of points they win by (in this example 6).</p>
<ul>
<li>Side 1 kill dice results: ( 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1) = 8 + 5 (excess battle score) = 13</li>
<li>Side 2 kill dice results: ( 5, 2, 4, 3, 4) = 18</li>
</ul>
<p>Those numbers represent how much of the opposing army is out of the fight (dead, injured, or captured). In this battle Side 1 won the battle, but Side 2 was able to cause a higher percentage of causalities.</p>
<p>18% x 1,000 = 180 troops out of the fight</p>
<p>13% x 500 = 65 troops out of the fight</p>
<p><strong>What happens next</strong></p>
<p>In an open field battle, the loser retreats and is run from the field. In a defense, another phase of battle will be run until either side gives in.</p>
<p>The mod running the battle will give a short blurb on what occurs in the fight. For this one, I would say something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite many casualties, Side 1 was able to get over the city's walls. Side 1 takes the inner side of the walls while Side 2 decides to continue the battle in the city streets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I can answer any questions or concerns you may have about the new system. All suggestion are of course welcome</strong></p>
<h3 id="wiki_sea">Sea</h3>
<h4 id="wiki_ships_types">Ships Types</h4>
<p><strong>Longship</strong><br>
100 oarsmen, all of which are fighters as well. Only the ironborn make them.  </p>
<p><strong>War Galley</strong><br>
135 - 100 oarsmen plus 35 fighters.  </p>
<p><strong>Heavy Dromonds</strong><br>
300 - 230 oarsmen plus 70 fighters  </p>
<p><strong>Flagships</strong><br>
Some of these can have up to 600 oars and will never exist in large quantities. For now, nobody can build them. Wait for a resource update.</p>
<p><em>Flagships and Heavy Dromonds are a superior troop type, so in the First Phase they're worth 1.5 galleys. Galleys are worth 1.2 longships in strength.</em> </p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Oarsmen and fighters are taken from your army size. If you put all of them in your ships, you won't have any soldier in the field.</p>
<h4 id="wiki_sea_combat_rules">Sea Combat Rules</h4>
<p><strong>NAVAL WARFARE</strong> </p>
<p>Naval warfare is very important and deserves its own system. I guess it is more complicated than battles between regular armies, but they're not as frequent and we will have an automated system soon, so it won't be a problem.  </p>
<p>First, each player will choose how many and which ships (in case there are flagships involved) will form each squadron.  </p>
<p>There is a practical maximum size of the front ranks in a naval battle, so you can't just put 1,000 ships in the same confrontation here. Of course huge battles like that existed, but even though they were a single battle in theory, confrontations were made separately by several admirals and kept apart from each other, otherwise tactics would fail.  </p>
<p><strong>CENTER</strong> - 65 ships<br>
<strong>LEFT and RIGHT</strong> - 50 ships  </p>
<p>These numbers are not secret and have to be determined in the conflict-commit thread.<br>
One side's left squadron will attack the right squadron from the other, and so on. Each will be dealt separately in dice rolls.</p>
<p><strong>FIRST PHASE</strong><br>
This is the ramming phase. Each squadron will roll d12s (not d6) according to their percentage in the total number of ships, just like battles on land in that regard. The average will be used as a final score and the winner will be determined. Next is the number of ships destroyed/captured using the following formula:<br>
WINNER: (lowest roll)/(highest roll)<br>
LOSER:   (higest roll)/(lowest roll)  </p>
<p><strong>Ship casualties are capped at 50% with a minimum of 5% for both sides.</strong><br>
However, not every ship is destroyed. <strong>50% of ship casualties on the losing side are captured by the winners</strong>. If Side 2 lost 30 ships, 15 sink and the other 15 go to Side 1 as new ships. </p>
<p><strong>SECOND PHASE</strong><br>
This is the time for boarding action. In this phase, the conflict will be rolled with similar rules to a regular field battle. The number of men for each side will be determined by [Ships*Boarding party], in which the boarding party is the number of fighters each ship has. The boarders are determined by whoever wins the first phase, while the losing side will be defending. Boarded ships are grappled and have reduced maneuverability, and also receive arrow volleys from the attackers. This means the attackers receive a +4 bonus in the end of the battle and the defenders have a -2 penalty.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: At this point, all upper bank oarsmen in galleys join the fight to defend their ships if they are boarded, so for every 100 oarsmen, 30 join the battle along with the fighters. </p>
<p>The rest of the battle will be just like a normal battle in open field, so there's no defensive bonus to either side.  </p>
<p><strong>The overall victory goes to the side with at least 2 winning squadrons.</strong></p>
<h2 id="wiki_duels">Duels</h2>
<p>First thing I want to explain how the fight itself would be. Each player will begin with a standard 30 Defense, a d6 for dealing damage, and a weapon of choice according to the attributes.<br>
The first choice is the attribute and the weapons. We have:<br>
STRENGTH - LUCK - CONSTITUTION - AGILITY -  </p>
<p><strong>STRENGTH</strong><br>
Strenght relies on brute force to deal more damage in general. The player will roll a d7 instead of the usual d6 in very encounter. The player starts with regular 30 Defense when using Strength. Whenever the enemy has less than half of his defense, every attack deals +1. However, if your Defense is below 15, enemy blows will receive a +1 bonus due to fatigue.</p>
<p>Weapons of choice:  Warhammer, Greatsword, Halberd, Longaxe  </p>
<p><strong>LUCK</strong><br>
Luck is about really testing how much the gods are willing to help you in the fight. The player will use normal d6 and 30 Defense but he rolls a d7 with a score between -3 and +3 in every encounter. Whenever he hits, any positive score(+1,+2,+3) will deal more damage to the opponent, while a negative one (-1,-2,-3) will reduce the damage dealt in the first dice. Whenever the player himself is hit in the encounter, the same rule is applied, except in this case the player may increase or decrease the damage inflicted by the opponent.<br>
It's like everytime you hit or get hit, you try another move with a dagger or throwing weapon. This could be a successful attack, or something that makes your enemy hurt you even more.</p>
<p>Weapons of choice: d6 weapons + short throwing weapons or daggers.  </p>
<p><strong>ENDURANCE</strong><br>
This attribute is about resisting with heavy armour and big shields, giving you a chance to have more dice rolls before the fight is over. The Defense is 40 instead of 30, and the dice will be d5, since the player won't be quick enough to deal heavier blows. As long as your Defense is higher than 20, every enemy hit will take a -1 penalty.   </p>
<p>Weapons of choice: Heavy shield + d6 weapons    </p>
<p><strong>AGILITY</strong><br>
This one is about speed and reflexes. You're going to use smaller and weaker weapons, but you also attack more. Your Defense is 20 because of light armour, and the dice will be d5, but every hit will grant another roll in a d4. In this extra d4, 3 or 4 will make you hit the enemy again for the same damage, while 1 or 2 do nothing. In short, there's a 50% chance that you hit your enemy again for the same damage.<br>
However, whenever you're hit, a d4 is rolled, and a 4 will make you dodge the attack completely, while a 1 gives the enemy a +1 bonus. </p>
<p>Weapons of choice: Shortsword, Spear, Hand Axe, Arakh, Braavosi Blade  </p>
<p>And the last one (I really have to see if this one would be too weak or overpowered)</p>
<p><strong>BOLDNESS</strong><br>
This is for the ones who like to study the enemy strategy and deal deadly counter-attacks. Those who dare use this attribute will alway take at least 1 hit in every 2 encounters. That is, the first attack will always hit you, and so will the third, the fifth, until you either win or die. The real perk is that, in even-number encounters, istead of a regular d6 you will roll a d20. The final damage in these encounters is decided like any other, but Boldness players will take the enemy roll damage if they do not score above 10.  </p>
<p>Weapons of choice: d6 weapons, shield and regular armour  </p>
<hr>
<p>The d6 weapons are: Longsword, Bastard Sword, Mace, Flail, Axe, Morningstar</p>
<p><strong>Valyrian steel gives one side to any kind of dice in any attribute.</strong></p>
<p>Here's an example:  Oberyn Martell x Gregor Clegane [<em>Agility x Strength</em>]  </p>
<p>Oberyn (20) 5 x 1 Gregor (30)<br>
Oberyn rolls 3 in the d4, deals 8 (+4 original, +4 extra) </p>
<p><em>Oberyn (20) 2 x 7 Gregor (22)</em><br>
Gregor deals 5 points  </p>
<p><em>Oberyn (15) 5 x 1 Gregor (22)</em><br>
Oberyn rolls 4 again, deals 8 points (+4 twice)  </p>
<p><em>Oberyn (15) 4 x 2 Gregor (14)</em><br>
Oberyn rolls 3, but Gregor has less than 15D, so he takes another 1  </p>
<p><em>Oberyn (15) 1 x 7 Gregor (11)</em><br>
Gregor deals 6 points  </p>
<p><em>Oberyn (9) 5 x 1 Gregor (11)</em><br>
Oberyn rolls 3. Gregor has less than 15 Defense, so he takes 9.  </p>
<p><em>Oberyn (9) 2 x 7 Gregor (2)</em><br>
Gregor deals 6 (5+1), Oberyn loses an eye  </p>
<p><em>Oberyn (3) 1 x 6 Gregor (2)</em><br>
Gregor deals 6(5+1), but this is the show so Oberyn's head explodes  </p>
<p>I know the example above had some extreme rolls, but it's just to show how it works.<br>
It would also be very nice to have someone write about the fight in RP, because some of the stories so far have been amazing.  </p>
<p>About attributes, I think it would be best if each player sent his choice to the mods before the fight, so there wouldn't be any risk of one choosing his strategy based on his opponent's. Another possibility is having your attribute defined in your wiki as a permanent choice, in order to have a proper champion selection and all.  </p>
